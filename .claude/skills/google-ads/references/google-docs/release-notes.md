[`DemandGenMultiAssetAds`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/DemandGenMultiAssetAdInfo). If enabled, it generates videos
using other assets like images and text. These videos can then be
used to create new [`DemandGenVideoResponsiveAds`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/DemandGenVideoResponsiveAdInfo). New
[`DemandGenMultiAssetAds`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/DemandGenMultiAssetAdInfo) are opted in by default.
- Renamed the field
`BudgetPerDayMinimumErrorDetails.minimum_bugdet_amount_micros` to
[`minimum_budget_amount_micros`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/BudgetPerDayMinimumErrorDetails#minimum_budget_amount_micros).

### General

- Added a limit of 10,000 operations per [`AddBatchJobOperations`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/BatchJobService#addbatchjoboperations)
request.
- Updated handling for the `page_size` field in
[`ListBatchJobResultsRequest`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/ListBatchJobResultsRequest):

  - If `page_size` is not set or is 0, it now defaults to the maximum of
    1,000 (previously returned `INVALID_PAGE_SIZE`).
  - If `page_size` exceeds 1,000, the API now returns an `INVALID_PAGE_SIZE`
    error (previously silently capped at 1,000).
- Added a new error code:
[`QuotaError.PAYMENTS_PROFILE_ACTIVATION_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/QuotaErrorEnum.QuotaError#payments_profile_activation_rate_limit_exceeded) to
indicate when the payment profile activation rates limit has been exceeded.

### Performance Max

- Added new [`AssetAutomationType`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/AssetAutomationTypeEnum.AssetAutomationType) values for Performance Max campaigns:

  - [`GENERATE_IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/AssetAutomationTypeEnum.AssetAutomationType#generate_image_enhancement): Enables automatic creation of
    enhanced images such as auto-cropping. Enabled by default.
  - [`GENERATE_IMAGE_EXTRACTION`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/AssetAutomationTypeEnum.AssetAutomationType#generate_image_extraction): Enables automatically sourcing images
    from final URLs. Defaults to the account-level Dynamic Image Extension
    setting.
- Removed `AssetPerformanceLabel` for Performance Max campaigns.
- The functionality of the removed [`Campaign.url_expansion_opt_out`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Campaign#url_expansion_opt_out) is
now managed by setting the `AssetAutomationType` [`FINAL_URL_EXPANSION_TEXT_ASSET_AUTOMATION`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/AssetAutomationTypeEnum.AssetAutomationType#final_url_expansion_text_asset_automation) in
[`AssetAutomationSetting`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Campaign#asset_automation_setting).
- Added new segments for Performance Max campaigns. Each of these segments is
only available for Performance Max campaigns and won't return data when any
other campaign type is selected.
  - [`ad_using_product_data`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#ad_using_product_data): Indicates if an ad uses product data from
    a Google Merchant Center feed.
  - [`ad_using_video`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#ad_using_video): Indicates if an ad uses a video asset.

### Planning

- In [`UserListCrmDataSourceType`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/UserListCrmDataSourceTypeEnum.UserListCrmDataSourceType), added the value
[`THIRD_PARTY_PARTNER_DATA`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/UserListCrmDataSourceTypeEnum.UserListCrmDataSourceType#third_party_partner_data).

  - Added new error codes related to partner audiences:
  - [`PARTNER_AUDIENCE_SOURCE_NOT_SUPPORTED_FOR_USER_LIST_TYPE`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/UserListErrorEnum.UserListError#partner_audience_source_not_supported_for_user_list_type)
  - [`PARTNER_AUDIENCE_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED_FOR_USER_LIST_TYPE`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/UserListErrorEnum.UserListError#partner_audience_type_not_supported_for_user_list_type)
  - [`COMMERCE_PARTNER_NOT_ALLOWED`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/UserListErrorEnum.UserListError#commerce_partner_not_allowed)
  - [`PARTNER_AUDIENCE_INFO_NOT_SUPPORTED_FOR_USER_LIST_TYPE`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/UserListErrorEnum.UserListError#partner_audience_info_not_supported_for_user_list_type)
  - [`PARTNER_MANAGER_ACCOUNT_DISALLOWED`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/UserListErrorEnum.UserListError#partner_manager_account_disallowed)

  - [`ACCOUNT_SETTING_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED_FOR_USER_LIST_TYPE`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/UserListErrorEnum.UserListError#account_setting_type_not_allowed_for_user_list_type)
  - [`INVALID_CAMPAIGN_TYPE_FOR_THIRD_PARTY_PARTNER_DATA_LIST`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/UserListErrorEnum.UserListError#invalid_campaign_type_for_third_party_partner_data_list)
- Added [`is_active_live_stream_creator`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/YouTubeMetrics#is_active_live_stream_creator) to [`YouTubeMetrics`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/YouTubeMetrics).
This is returned by
[`ContentCreatorInsightsService.GenerateCreatorInsights`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/ContentCreatorInsightsService#generatecreatorinsights) and indicates
if a creator published a livestream in the past 90 days.
- Added a new [`PlannableUserListMetadata`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/PlannableUserListMetadata) message that contains
[`UserListCrmDataSourceType`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/UserListCrmDataSourceTypeEnum.UserListCrmDataSourceType) in [`PlannableUserList`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/PlannableUserList). This
message is returned by ['ReachPlanService.ListPlannableUserLists'](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/ReachPlanService#listplannableuserlists) to
show if a CRM user list data source is either `FIRST_PARTY` or
`THIRD_PARTY_PARTNER_DATA`.

- In [`ReachPlanService`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/ReachPlanService), added the field [`trueview_views`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/ReachPlanService#trueview_views), which
replaces the [`views`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/ReachPlanService#views) field.

- In [`TrendInsight`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/TrendInsight), added support for [`related_videos`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/TrendInsight#related_videos) and
[`related_creators`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/TrendInsight#related_creators). Also added video properties metadata and publish
dates in [`YouTubeVideoAttributeMetadata.video_properties`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/YouTubeVideoAttributeMetadata#video_properties) and
[`YouTubeVideoAttributeMetadata.publish_date`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/YouTubeVideoAttributeMetadata#publish_date).

  - [`AudienceInsightsService.GenerateInsightsFinderReport`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/AudienceInsightsService#generateinsightsfinderreport) now
    supports [`parental_status`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/InsightsAudience#parental_status) and [`income_ranges`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/InsightsAudience#income_ranges), and more
    complex AND/OR combinations of topics and audiences.

### Reports

- Added two new click types: [`CLICK_TO_MESSAGE_THIRD_PARTY_CLICK`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/ClickTypeEnum.ClickType#click_to_message_third_party_click) and
[`CLICK_TO_MESSAGE_LANDING_PAGE_CLICK`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/ClickTypeEnum.ClickType#click_to_message_landing_page_click).
- [`AssetGroupAsset`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/AssetGroupAsset) is now segmentable by [`device`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#device),
[`conversion_action`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#conversion_action),
[`conversion_action_name`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#conversion_action_name), and
[`conversion_action_category`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#conversion_action_category).
- [`AdGroupAdAssetView`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v23/AdGroupAdAssetView) now fully supports performance and conversion
metrics for
[`RESPONSIVE_SEARCH_AD`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/AdTypeEnum.AdType#responsive_search_ad). Previously, only impressions were
returned for this ad type in this view.
- To facilitate Smart Bidding Exploration, the following metrics are now
segmentable by date fields ( [`date`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#date), [`month`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#month), [`quarter`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#quarter),
[`week`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#week), [`year`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Segments#year)):

  - [`clicks_unique_query_clusters`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Metrics#clicks_unique_query_clusters)
  - [`conversions_unique_query_clusters`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Metrics#conversions_unique_query_clusters)
  - [`impressions_unique_query_clusters`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Metrics#impressions_unique_query_clusters)
- Added a new resource: [`TargetingExpansionView`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/TargetingExpansionView), which reports metrics
for expansions over manual targeting, such as keywordless expansion for AI
Max for Search Campaigns.
- Added new segments for PMax campaigns. See [Performance Max updates](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/release-notes#performance-max-v22).

### Shopping

- Fixed the campaign and ad group scoping of metrics in the
[`ShoppingProduct`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v23/ShoppingProduct) resource.


### Unified goals

- Added support for customer retention goals to optimize for re-engaging
existing customers.
  - Configure targeting using
    [`CampaignRetentionGoalSettings.target_option`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/CampaignGoalSettings.CampaignRetentionGoalSettings#target_option):
     \\* [`TARGET_SPECIFIC`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/CustomerLifecycleOptimizationModeEnum.CustomerLifecycleOptimizationMode#target_specific): Only uses users from user lists
     associated with the campaign. (Currently allowlist only).
    - [`TARGET_ALL`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/CustomerLifecycleOptimizationModeEnum.CustomerLifecycleOptimizationMode#target_all) (Default): Targets all users for re-engagement.

### Video

- Renamed several video-views related metrics:
  - `average_cpv` is now [`trueview_average_cpv`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Metrics#trueview_average_cpv)
  - `video_view_rate` is now [`video_trueview_view_rate`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Metrics#video_trueview_view_rate)
  - `video_views` is now [`video_trueview_views`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Metrics#video_trueview_views)
  - `video_view_rate_in_feed` is now
    [`video_trueview_view_rate_in_feed`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Metrics#video_trueview_view_rate_in_feed)
  - `video_view_rate_in_stream` is now
    [`video_trueview_view_rate_in_stream`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Metrics#video_trueview_view_rate_in_stream)
  - `video_view_rate_shorts` is now [`video_trueview_view_rate_shorts`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Metrics#video_trueview_view_rate_shorts)
- Added metrics for video ad watch time:
  - [`video_watch_time_duration_millis`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/Metrics#video_watch_time_duration_millis): Total watch time.

The following new feature was added in v21.1.

### Account management

- Added the `contains_eu_political_advertising` field to the
[`Customer`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/Customer) resource. This field retrieves the
account-level declaration status of whether it contains political
advertising targeted towards the EU, and returns an
[`EuPoliticalAdvertisingStatusEnum`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v23/EuPoliticalAdvertisingStatusEnum).

### Campaigns

- Added `Campaign.missing_eu_political_advertising_declaration` to support
querying and filtering campaigns that are missing declarations about whether
they contain political advertising targeted towards the EU.

### AI Max for Search campaigns

- You can now use the [`ai_max_setting.enable_ai_max`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/Campaign.AiMaxSetting#enable_ai_max) field of the
[`Campaign`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/Campaign) to enable AI Max for Search campaigns. AI Max for Search
campaigns expands a Search campaign's reach through search term matching and
allows controlling whether targeting and creative controls serve when set.
Text asset automation and brand list controls that were set in previous
version requests will still be respected until AI Max for Search campaigns
is explicitly toggled and turned off.
[`Campaign.ai_max_setting.bundling_required`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/Campaign.AiMaxSetting#bundling_required) can be used to determine
if AI Max for Search campaigns must be enabled to respect or modify text
asset automation and brand list controls.
[`AdGroup.ai_max_ad_group_setting.disable_search_term_matching`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/AdGroup.AiMaxAdGroupSetting#disable_search_term_matching) can be
used to disable search term matching when a parent campaign has enabled AI
Max for Search campaigns. See our blog post [Unlock next-level performance\\
with AI Max for Search campaigns](https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/google-ai-max-for-search-campaigns/).

- Added [`CampaignError.AI_MAX_MUST_BE_ENABLED`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/CampaignErrorEnum.CampaignError#ai_max_must_be_enabled), which is thrown for
Search campaigns when you opt in to
[`FINAL_URL_EXPANSION_TEXT_ASSET_AUTOMATION`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/AssetAutomationTypeEnum.AssetAutomationType#final_url_expansion_text_asset_automation) without enabling AI Max
for Search campaigns on the campaign.

- Added support for applying targeting controls at the ad group level in AI
Max for Search campaigns. You can now add the following criteria to ad
groups:

  - Brand lists
  - Locations
  - Webpages (URL rules)
- Added the [`ai_max_search_term_ad_combination_view`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v24/ai_max_search_term_ad_combination_view) to report on
performance for combinations of search terms, headlines, and landing pages.
This view shows which search queries triggered your ads and how those
specific combinations performed. A future release will include an additional
view that also includes Performance Max data. If you want to avoid migrating
your implementation to get Performance Max data, consider waiting for that
release.

- Added `AI_MAX` as a new value for the [`search_term_match_type`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v24/segments#segments.search_term_match_type)
segment.


### Assets

- Added the fields `terms_and_conditions_text`, `terms_and_conditions_uri`,
`promotion_barcode_info`, and `promotion_qr_code_info` in
[`PromotionAsset`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/PromotionAsset). Barcode and QR code
fields are located within the `promotion_trigger` oneof. See the Help Center
article [About promotion assets](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7367521).

- Added [`FINAL_URL_EXPANSION_TEXT_ASSET_AUTOMATION`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/AssetAutomationTypeEnum.AssetAutomationType#final_url_expansion_text_asset_automation) to
[`AssetAutomationTypeEnum`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/AssetAutomationTypeEnum.AssetAutomationType). With this setting, you can control the
automatic generation of text assets and landing pages from the final URL in
Search campaigns.

- Added a new service
[`AutomaticallyCreatedAssetRemovalService.RemoveCampaignAutomaticallyCreatedAsset`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/AutomaticallyCreatedAssetRemovalService/RemoveCampaignAutomaticallyCreatedAsset)
to remove automatically created assets from `Campaign`. This service
supports removal of the final URL expansion asset only.

- Added `DESCRIPTION_PREFIX` to the [`ServedAssetFieldType`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v23/ServedAssetFieldTypeEnum.ServedAssetFieldType) enum. This
corrects an issue where the `served_asset_field_type` in
[`ad_group_ad_asset_combination_view`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v24/ad_group_ad_asset_combination_view) was `UNKNOWN` for assets serving
as a description prefix.


### Campaigns

- Added a new enum value `MISSING_LOCATION_TARGETING` to
[`CampaignPrimaryStatusReason`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/CampaignPrimaryStatusReasonEnum.CampaignPrimaryStatusReason). This new status reason will be
returned only for location-restricted campaigns which don't specify location
targeting. For location-restricted campaigns, any attempt to add location
targeting outside the allowed area will result in the criterion error
[`LOCATION_TARGETING_NOT_ELIGIBLE_FOR_RESTRICTED_CAMPAIGN`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/CriterionErrorEnum.CriterionError#location_targeting_not_eligible_for_restricted_campaign).

- Added support for third-party integration partners on the
[`VideoCustomer.third_party_integration_partners`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/VideoCustomer#third_party_integration_partners) and
[Campaign.third\_party\_integration\_partners](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/Campaign#third_party_integration_partners) levels. See the Help Center
article [Track app conversions with third-party app analytics](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7382633).

- You can now set the `advertising_partner_ids` field for an existing
[`Campaign`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/Campaign). Previously, this field could only be set for a new
campaign during its creation. The field is still immutable after being set.

- By using a shared list of type `NEGATIVE_PLACEMENTS` defined at the manager
account level, advertisers can now use `CustomerNegativeCriterion` criteria
to exclude a list of placements in individual advertiser customer accounts.

- Added `DESCRIPTION_PREFIX` to the [`ServedAssetFieldType`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v23/ServedAssetFieldTypeEnum.ServedAssetFieldType) enum. This
corrects an issue where the `served_asset_field_type` in the
[`ad_group_ad_asset_combination_view`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v24/ad_group_ad_asset_combination_view) was `UNKNOWN` for assets serving
as a description prefix.

- Added support for the field `target_roas_tolerance_percent_millis` in the
[`MaximizeConversionValue`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v22/MaximizeConversionValue) and [`TargetRoas`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/TargetRoas) bidding strategies.
[`TargetRoas.target_roas_tolerance_percent_millis`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/TargetRoas#target_roas_tolerance_percent_millis) is only available
for portfolio strategies, which is only available for Search campaigns.

- Changed a `ProductGroup` error code. For requests with a partial failure
enabled, [`LISTING_GROUP_ERROR_IN_ANOTHER_OPERATION`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/CriterionErrorEnum.CriterionError#listing_group_error_in_another_operation) will be returned
instead of
[`INVALID_LISTING_GROUP_HIERARCHY`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/CriterionErrorEnum.CriterionError#invalid_listing_group_hierarchy).

- Added a new resource [`LocationInterestView`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/LocationInterestView) that summarizes the performance of
adgroup location interest criteria.


### Conversions

- Added `ENGAGED_VIEW` as a new value for the
[`conversion_attribution_event_type`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v24/segments#segments.conversion_attribution_event_type) segment.

- Customers will no longer have access to `debug_enabled` mode in
[`ConversionUploadService`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/ConversionUploadService). This field, if set to `TRUE`, was earlier
used to distinguish the [`CLICK_NOT_FOUND`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/ConversionUploadErrorEnum.ConversionUploadError#click_not_found) error from `SUCCESS` for
enhanced conversions for leads imports.


### Demand Gen

- Added an error code [`CampaignBudgetError.BUDGET_BELOW_DAILY_MINIMUM`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/CampaignBudgetErrorEnum.CampaignBudgetError#budget_below_per_day_minimum).
In the future, this error will be returned when attempting to set a very low
budget amount for a Demand Gen campaign. Details about the required minimum
budget can be found in the new error details field
[`budgetDailyMinimumErrorDetails`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/BudgetPerDayMinimumErrorDetails).

### EU political advertising changes

These EU political advertising changes have also been made in the [v19.2](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/archived-release-notes#v192_2025-08-06)
and [v20.1](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/release-notes#v201-2025-08-06) releases.

- Added [`Campaign.contains_eu_political_advertising`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/Campaign#contains_eu_political_advertising). This field
indicates whether your campaign contains political advertising content
targeted towards the European Union. If this field is set to
`CONTAINS_EU_POLITICAL_ADVERTISING`, the campaign will no longer serve in
the EU starting September 22, 2025. API calls to create a new campaign will
fail with a [`FieldError.REQUIRED`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/FieldErrorEnum.FieldError#required) error if this field is not set.

For any existing campaigns, you should set the
`contains_eu_political_advertising` field before attempting to change
proximity, location, or location group targeting either at the campaign or
ad group levels. The API calls to create or update these campaign or ad
group criteria for existing campaigns will fail with a
[`CriterionError.MISSING_EU_POLITICAL_ADVERTISING_SELF_DECLARATION`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/CriterionErrorEnum.CriterionError#missing_eu_political_advertising_self_declaration)
error if the campaign hasn't completed the self-declaration.

For versions v19.x and 20.x, the requirement to set this field is not yet
enforced, but will be in the future. This change will be announced in
advance.

- Trials and Experiments will throw an
[`ExperimentError.MISSING_EU_POLITICAL_ADVERTISING_SELF_DECLARATION`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/ExperimentErrorEnum.ExperimentError#missing_eu_political_advertising_self_declaration)
if the experiment's campaigns haven't self-declared whether they contain
political advertising that targets the European Union.


### Performance Max

- For new PMax campaigns the default value of
[`Campaign.brand_guidelines_enabled`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/Campaign#brand_guidelines_enabled) is now `true`.

- Added the [`campaign_search_term_view`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v24/campaign_search_term_view) report. This view offers search
terms metrics aggregated at the campaign level. This view also introduces
